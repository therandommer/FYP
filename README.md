This is the GitHub repository for my Final Year Project for university.
There are several different versions available from different points in development. 

KNOWN BUGS:

- Placement sometimes doesn't validate. To fix hover over an already placed block.
- If you do not have a door and a player placed, the game will not let you play (sometimes it does) but won't tell you why.
- Certain objects have a 3X scale, so their placement and subsequent erasing hitbox is larger than intended. These objects include: - The player, Patroling Enemy, Shooting Enemy, Fireball.
